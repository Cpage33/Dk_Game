# Welcome to my Donkey Kong style game

To start playing my version of Donkey Kong run the kong.html file.

To move use the left and right arrow keys 

To jump use the up arrow

Once hit by a barrel, to leave the game over scene click the restart button or refresh page.

The goal of the game is to climb to the top of the page as many times as possible without getting struck with a barrel.

Thank you for playing my game

This game was started for CPSC 4950 at Anderson University
All graphics used for this came from screenshots of the original Donkey Kong and I do not own these characters.
